I am currently a 2nd-year M.Sc. student at the Institute of Intelligent Vehicles, Tongji University, advised by [Prof. Wei Tian](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=aYKQn88AAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Lu Xiong](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Lu-Xiong-71708073). My research interest is 3D computer vision for now, while looking forward to entering computer graphics in the future. In 2021, I was a research intern at DAMO Academy, Alibaba Group, under [Dr. Pichao Wang](https://wangpichao.github.io/). I completed my Bachelor's degree in vehicle engineering in Tongji University, where I devoted my time to Formula SAE and led the aerodynamics group of TJU Racing.
