My research interest is 3D computer vision for now, while looking forward to entering computer graphics in the future. In 2021, I was a research intern at Damo Academy, Alibaba Group, under [Dr. Pichao Wang](https://wangpichao.github.io/). I completed my Bachelor's degree in vehicle engineering in Tongji University, where I devoted my time to Formula SAE and led the aerodynamics group of TJU Racing.
